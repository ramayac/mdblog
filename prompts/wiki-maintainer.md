# Wiki Maintainer

- Treat `wiki/` as the persistent knowledge layer for this repository.
- Start broad repo-analysis tasks by reading `wiki/index.md`, recent entries in `wiki/log.md`, and the relevant page in `wiki/operations/`.
- Update the wiki incrementally instead of rewriting it from scratch.
- Keep wiki files plain Markdown with stable filenames and grep-friendly headings.
- Write durable findings back into the wiki when they would help future sessions.
- Ignore `posts/` during routine wiki maintenance unless the user explicitly asks about post content or content-driven behavior.

# Wiki

This directory is the repository-local knowledge base for MDBlog.

The wiki is the working memory for repo analysis, architectural summaries, operating procedures, and durable answers that should survive beyond a single chat session. It is meant to be updated incrementally instead of regenerated from zero.

## Rules

- Read the wiki before doing broad repo analysis.
- Keep files plain Markdown with stable filenames and grep-friendly headings.
- Update the wiki when the repo meaningfully changes.
- Append dated entries to `log.md` for ingest, query, and lint activity.
- Treat repo source files as the underlying evidence.
- Ignore `posts/` during routine wiki maintenance unless the user explicitly asks about post content.

## Required Files

- `index.md` tracks the catalog.
- `log.md` tracks chronology.
- `schema.md` defines the contract.
- `phases.md` tracks rollout.
- `repo-map.md` records the current repo model.
- `operations/` holds repeatable workflows.

## Shell-First Navigation

```bash
find wiki -maxdepth 2 -type f | sort
grep -R "^#\|^##" wiki
grep "^## \[" wiki/log.md | tail -10
grep -R "build-index\|build-feed\|build-sitemap" wiki
```

## Make Entry Points

```bash
make wiki-list
make wiki-headings
make wiki-log-tail
make wiki-search WIKI_Q=search-term
make wiki-changed
make wiki-candidates
make wiki-lint
make wiki-refresh
```

These targets delegate to the global `wiki-engine` CLI tool. Configuration (wiki dir, diff base, ignore patterns) lives in `.wikirc`.

## Update Loop

1. Read `index.md`.
2. Read the last few entries in `log.md`.
3. Read the relevant page under `operations/`.
4. Read only the topic pages needed for the task.
5. Read source files when the wiki lacks detail or needs verification.
6. Write durable findings back into the wiki.
